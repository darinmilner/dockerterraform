Docker deployment Infrastructure as Code written in Terraform

This example pulls Nodered, Grafana, and InfluxDB images from
Dockerhub and creates a network with volumes and containers of
the images.  

This example uses variables and modules to make it more reusable.
tfstate files are not checked into Github and can be stored
locally or in an AWS S3 bucket or on Terraform Cloud. 

noderedvol folder is included as an example of saving data from the 
nodered container when it is destroyed.
